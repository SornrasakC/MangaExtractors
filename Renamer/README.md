# Automated Renamer

## Usage
1. Start / run [worker](rename_worker.py)
2. Open dev tool then (Application => Frames => top => images).
3. Try clicking on blob links.
4. Drag and drop the blob images to the Workspace folder.
5. You might want to drag them in order manually (I will work on automation when I got a mood for it)
